# game-20261021-487c75b1

Exported from Tesana on 2026-10-22 (game id `game-20261021-487c75b1`).

This is a complete, standalone TypeScript web game — plain Three.js /
Phaser / Rapier code, with `package.json`, `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`
in this zip pinned to the same library versions the game was built with.

It is also wired to Tesana's play service so your saves and shop keep working.

## What's inside

- `index.html` — the page that boots the game.
- `src/` — the game's TypeScript source (`src/main.ts` is the entry).
- `assets/` — every model, texture, sprite, sound and font the game uses.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # static site in dist/
```

The build output is plain HTML/JS/assets — drop the `dist/` folder on any
static host (itch.io, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3). If the game
loads Draco-compressed models it expects the decoder files under
`public/decoders/` (copied by `npm run build` via the Vite config).

## Tesana services

This export is wired to Tesana's play service, so the game's cloud saves,
leaderboards, achievements and shop keep working when you run it yourself.
`index.html` loads the play SDK and sets `window.__TESANA__` to this game's id
(`game-20261021-487c75b1`); the game code is unchanged and already awaits the SDK.

- Saves follow whoever is signed in on that device; with nobody signed in the
  game gets a guest identity and still plays.
- Nothing here is secret. The SDK mints its own per-player credential at
  runtime, so there is no key to rotate or leak.
- The SDK is loaded from a pinned URL, so a fix we publish does not silently
  change this copy. Nothing breaks if you are offline — every call resolves.

Offline is a supported state, not an error: with no network the game plays.

## Not included

- Tesana's session history, snapshots, internal metadata, and the
  Studio-only loading/watermark shell that Tesana injects at publish time.
